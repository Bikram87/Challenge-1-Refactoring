## Usage

To access the codebase with accessible standards, you can open Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (MacOS) or Control+shift+I (Windows). A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. There you will see the source code containg all semantic elements, a descriptive website title, alt text on all images, heading elements order in sequence, and elements following a logical structure.
